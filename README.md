# iEEG Cleaning and Analysis

This repository provides the complete Python implementation supporting the analyses presented in this thesis. It includes routines for intracranial EEG preprocessing, such as bipolar referencing and zero‐phase FIR filtering, robust artifact detection and removal, interactive trial and channel rejection, multitaper spectral estimation, circular–linear correlation analyses, permutation‐based significance testing, anatomical region mapping and visualization, and stimulus‐orientation decoding from high‐frequency spectral features. The artifact detection methods follow the procedures introduced by Staresina et al. (2015), although with several posterior modifications, and with their segment padding and gap‐filling logic to ensure contiguous artifact blocks. Interactive rejection of epochs and channels employs the Autoreject library, which must be installed to enable the visual rejection widgets. In addition, several helper functions depend on the decoding_toolbox (https://github.com/alepebel/decoding_toolbox/tree/main), and this toolbox must be installed prior to running the analysis scripts.
